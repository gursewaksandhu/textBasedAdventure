Hi Gursewak, we recognize that you did the best you could here!!  Version control is an important tool; please try to practice using it with someone before you take CSC209 or CSC301, for example.  Handling merge requests is an important skill, for example!!  Am sorry you were not able to practice this as much as we might have liked in CSC207.
